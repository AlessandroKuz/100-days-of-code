# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 8, 2025

**Today's Progress**: [Started a static personal website](https://github.com/AlessandroKuz/AlessandroKuz.github.io/tree/cceb488432c5db8fac7b0c56013feb4ff692c00e),
recorded an introductory video and
then started the `prerequisites` section of [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the introductory video, but the setup for the web page was easy.
I noticed that copying over the navbar was a bit tedious and error-prone, so i should probably consider switching to
maybe flask or django? For now, it will stay static.
Did not have any issue on the Odin Project part, maybe a bit tedious since the information was already known.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble with the introductory video, since I'm not use to talking and explaining to a camera;
setting up the website was straightforward (although it was a very simple one).
I found copying the navbar a bit tedious and prone to errors, so I’m thinking about switching to Flask or Django.
For now, though, it’ll remain static.
I didn’t face any issues with the Odin Project section, although it felt a bit repetitive since the information was already familiar.
