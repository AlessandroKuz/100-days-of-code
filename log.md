# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: March 8, 2025

**Today's Progress**: [Started a static personal website](https://github.com/AlessandroKuz/AlessandroKuz.github.io/tree/cceb488432c5db8fac7b0c56013feb4ff692c00e),
recorded an introductory video and
then started the `prerequisites` section of [The Odin Project's Foundations course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations).

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with the introductory video, but the setup for the web page was easy.
I noticed that copying over the navbar was a bit tedious and error-prone, so i should probably consider switching to
maybe flask or django? For now, it will stay static.
Did not have any issue on the Odin Project part, maybe a bit tedious since the information was already known.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of trouble with the introductory video, since I'm not use to talking and explaining to a camera;
setting up the website was straightforward (although it was a very simple one).
I found copying the navbar a bit tedious and prone to errors, so I’m thinking about switching to Flask or Django.
For now, though, it’ll remain static.
I didn’t face any issues with the Odin Project section, although it felt a bit repetitive since the information was already familiar.

## Day 2: March 9, 2025

**Today's Progress**: A little bit of study of the internet and web fundamentals

**Thoughts**: Could have studied a bit more, but it's okay!


## Day 3: March 13, 2025

**Note**: There is a 3 days break due to sickness...

**Today's Progress**: Configured the DNS to the personal website, started working on automatic curriculum generation from a json. Strted using uv and poetry.

**Thoughts**: Need to find out a proper way to link the curriculum to the personal website. Should explore more the usage of uv and poetry in python projects.

## Day 4: March 18, 2025

**Note**: Despite the ongoing sickness I decided to keep goin in my Web studies, today I focused on learning more about HTTP, the Web, the Internet and Requests. I also setup a simple Obsidian Vault which I committed to GitHub.

**Today's Progress**: Today I studied a bit more of the Web and how it works, I understood that basically it's just a fancy way to allow different computers/machines to interact with each other, whilst also allowing to set important rules, for example autorization, protocols, etc.

**Thoughts**: I like how I setup the Vault and the idea of tracking what I learn gives me the comfort of not "losing knowledge"; even though I don't write down everything when I'm first learning a new concept, I like to keep track of the concepts I touched upon, so that in the future I can decide whether I should delve further in a concept or if I've already explored it enough.

## Day 5: March 19, 2025

**Note**: Kept studying basic Web notions, going throught the main introductory articles of MDN.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the introductory material of MDN, stopping shy of the HTML articles.

**Thoughts**: Kept going, happy to acquire the necessary notions, as in my current web journey I already have some basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript knowledge, but I keep lacking in the HTTP, Requests and Protocols department.

## Day 6: March 20, 2025

**Note**: Kept going over the MDN learn "Getting Started" modules.

**Today's Progress**: Reinforced the learnt concepts and reviewed some stuff to start actually working on practical concepts. I also fiddled with `husky` for pre-commit hooks in web projects.

**Thoughts**: I probably misconfigured something with husky, but being the first time that I do something with Node and npm it was expected, with time I'll get it.
